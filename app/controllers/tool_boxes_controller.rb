        "Dear Alliance Leader,\n
        I hope this email finds you well and prospering in all you do!\n
        I recently learned of an organization that is creating a Christian movement across South Carolina, the SC Christian Chamber of Commerce (C3) and I thought about you.\n
        The vision of C3 is to unify Christian Businesses, Alliances (non-profits), Churches, and Individuals to positively impact our community. There are many benefits for your alliance’s investment of $99 per year, which includes: monthly networking meetings to promote your alliance; promotion at the meetings and on the website; statewide calendar where you can post events; platform where you can submit your own campaigns for charitable needs; unity prayer coin and window decal for your car or alliance.\n
        For more information, go to: https://www.sc-c3.org.  Also, if you know others who will benefit from this movement, please share this information with them and encourage them to become a member.\n
        Thanks for all you do to make our community a better place,",
